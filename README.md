# Network-Design-and-Configuration-with-VLSM-Routing-Protocols-and-Access-Control
The project aims to design and configure a computer network using Packet Tracer, implementing VLSM (Variable Length Subnet Masking) for efficient IP address allocation. The network consists of multiple blocks with different routing protocols (EIGRP, OSPF, RIP) and specific requirements for DHCP server allocation, NAT implementation, and access control using access lists. The objective is to successfully set up and troubleshoot the network within a given time frame, ensuring proper routing, subnetting, and access restrictions.
